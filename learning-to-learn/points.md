## Things that work for me in order to learn something

- If I have to learn only one topic since it is not overwhelming, it seems to work most of the time, Things that are related to the topic is also easier to branch out, Example: Learning about Dependency Injection but also getting difference between IOC, DI.
- 2 hours after work and on evening around 8 PM seems to work better
